## Overview

This project is a web application built with FastAPI that allows users to create and manage a personal e-portfolio.

The platform provides both public and private features:

* User registration
* Secure authentication

| name            | String      |
| first_name      | String      |
| birth_date      | Date        |
| mail            | String      |
| phone           | String      |
| hashed_password | String      |

### Experience

| Field       | Type        |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| id          | Primary Key |
| title       | String      |
| company     | String      |
| date_start  | Date        |
| date_end    | Date        |
| description | String      |
| user_id     | Foreign Key |

### Education

| Field       | Type        |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| id          | Primary Key |
| school_name | String      |
| major       | String      |
| date_start  | Date        |
| date_end    | Date        |

## Relationships

### User → Experience (1:N)

A user can own multiple professional experiences.

### User → Education (1:N)

A user can own multiple education entries.

Relationship rules:

* One experience belongs to one user.
* One education entry belongs to one user.
* Deleting a user removes access to their associated records.

## Local Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd e-portfolio
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Windows:

```bash
env\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Start the Application

fastapi dev
```

Application available at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

---

## Docker Deployment

### Build Image

```bash
docker build -t e-portfolio .
```

### Start Container

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Rebuild Container

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

---

## Automated Deployment

The production environment uses an automated deployment strategy directly executed on the virtual machine.

Every 2 minutes, a deployment script checks the `prod-vm` branch and automatically deploys any new version.

### Deployment Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "DEPLOY $(date)"

cd /home/yassine/web_prog/e-portfolio || exit 1

git pull origin prod-vm

sudo docker compose up -d --build

sudo docker image prune -f

echo "DEPLOY DONE $(date)"
```

### Cron Configuration

```cron
*/2 * * * * /home/yassine/deploy.sh >> /home/yassine/deploy.log 2>&1
```

### Deployment Workflow

1. Fetch latest code from GitHub.
2. Pull updates from the `prod-vm` branch.
3. Rebuild Docker image.
4. Recreate application container.
5. Remove unused Docker images.
6. Store deployment logs.

### Deployment Logs

```text
/home/yassine/deploy.log
```

### Benefits

* Fully automated deployment.
* No manual intervention required.
* No public SSH exposure.
* Compatible with Proxmox and NAT environments.
* Automatic Docker image cleanup.
* Continuous synchronization with the production branch.

## Notes

* The SQLite database is automatically created on startup.
* Authentication relies on JWT tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies.
* Passwords are hashed before storage using Argon2.
* Pagination is implemented on the public homepage and search results.
* Docker is used for production deployment.
